# Open TAC

**Version 1.0.4**

This project is inspired by the project "inFORM" made by MIT Media Lab and we aim to make a small version with an appropriate price.


## Video

This video gives the general purpose and construction of the project.

## Prerequisites

What things you need to install the system


| Material      | Count  |
| ------------- | -----:|
| Servo Motors       |   64 |
| Electronic Circuit |    1 |
| Arduino            |    1 |
| Wooden Plates      |    1 |
| Power Supply (5V 20A)      |    1 |
| 3D Prints           |   |

## Installing

### 3D Printing
First of all we should print all of the parts from 3D printer. In first try we used model from [*DesignCell*](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2038205). But we changed the model to sit appropriate the cover.
You can find all 3D designs in the folder. I also add the 3D parts to [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/musas/designs) that you can download easily.  We use [Craftware](https://craftunique.com/craftware/) as a slicer. After slice the models with these adjusments;

- [x] 0.3mm **Layer Height** 
- [x] 50 mm/s **Draw Speed**
- [x] **No Raft- No Support**

After 120 hours of printing now we're all done!

After that models be like that.

Put the model3 (in the folder) top of the rod.

### Installing the Cover

After mounting each servo motor, let's put in the system. You should watch out the aligment of the motors.

## Circuit Designs & Schematics

The current circuit so basic and so easy to control the sytem. We use [**PCA9685**](https://www.adafruit.com/product/815) from Adafruit for controlling servo motors. You should adress the boards before wiring. Adressing can be like:

- [x] 0x40
- [x] 0x41
- [x] 0x42
- [x] 0x43

In the current system we use Arduino Nano that use AtMega328 as microcontroller. But it can be insufficient for memory. So we can
use Atmega2560 as an alternative. We designed a PCB that we can control the system gerber files included in the project detail.

- [ ] Tested

## Software Part
You can control the system like
```c++
SET_SERVO(0000000011111111222222223333333344444444555555556666666677777777);
GO();
```
